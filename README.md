# BHM-SST-Paleo-Reconstruction
This repository provides the dataset, R scripts, and STAN scripts for implementing the Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) for estimating Paleo-SST reconstruction in the Equatorial Pacific, as proposed in _Ossandón et al. (2024)_.

## Dataset
This dataset is used as input for implementing a space-time Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) to reconstruct annual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) during the Holocene over a large domain based on SST at limited proxy locations in the equatorial (10°N-10°S) Pacific. The dataset consists of 2° gridded annual mean SST between 1854 and 2014, the paleo proxy SST data from 28 locations, locations of spatial knots, and the location of points used to calibrate the model.
